# terraform-examples
This project contains examples from projects I am working on in terraform inspired by personal and work projects. The directory structure is based on <terraform version>/<project>. I have reformatted this project this way because I had to refactor the static web project due to Terraform versioning issues. I wanted to make this project more versatile to support multiple projects and versions of those projects.

## Before you go
DISCLAIMER: By the nature of these projects you are creating resources in the cloud. That means depending on your account status and what resources are created you may be charged. Be forewarned... I am not responsible if you do receive any charges for resources you create in any account using this project. With that in mind, please enjoy because I think cloud infrastructure is a democratization of computing that allows people of all financial positions to at least begin to create and host projects. There are a lot of free tier offerings that can help get you started.
